    description: "The Subaru Solterra represents the Japanese automaker's first all-electric vehicle, developed jointly with Toyota (which sells its version as the bZ4X) on a dedicated EV platform called e-SUBARU Global Platform. The name 'Solterra' combines the Latin words for 'sun' and 'earth,' reflecting the vehicle's environmentally conscious positioning while maintaining a connection to Subaru's nature-oriented brand image. Measuring approximately 184.6 inches in length, the Solterra adopts a crossover SUV form with distinctive styling elements including sharp, angular headlights, prominent black wheel arch cladding, and a coupe-like roofline with a split rear spoiler. Ground clearance of 8.3 inches maintains Subaru's traditional focus on off-road capability, supported by a new dual-motor all-wheel drive system dubbed 'Symmetrical All-Wheel Drive e-SUBARU,' with one electric motor powering each axle for a combined output of 215 horsepower and 248 lb-ft of torque. Powered by a 72.8 kWh lithium-ion battery, the Solterra offers an EPA-estimated range of approximately 220-230 miles depending on trim level, with DC fast-charging capability allowing for an 80% charge in about an hour under ideal conditions. The interior features a minimalist design centered around a high-mounted 12.3-inch touchscreen infotainment system and a digital instrument cluster positioned far forward on the dashboard, creating a unique spatial arrangement. Standard equipment includes heated front seats, a heat pump system for efficient climate control in cold weather, and Subaru's EyeSight driver assistance technology offering adaptive cruise control, pre-collision braking, and lane-keeping assistance. Off-road oriented features include X-Mode with Grip Control, which optimizes the electric motors' output for varying terrain, and Downhill Assist Control for controlled descents on steep gradients. While sharing its fundamental architecture with Toyota's bZ4X, the Solterra features distinct tuning for the steering, suspension, and all-wheel drive system to maintain Subaru's characteristic driving feel. As Subaru's entry into the rapidly expanding electric crossover segment, the Solterra aims to appeal to the brand's traditional customer base of outdoor enthusiasts and safety-conscious families while attracting new buyers interested in zero-emission vehicles with genuine all-weather and light off-road capability."
