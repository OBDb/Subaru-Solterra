    description: "The Subaru Solterra represents the Japanese automaker's first all-electric vehicle, developed jointly with Toyota (which sells its version as the bZ4X) on a dedicated EV platform called e-SUBARU Global Platform. The name 'Solterra' combines the Latin words for 'sun' and 'earth,' reflecting the vehicle's environmentally conscious positioning while maintaining a connection to Subaru's nature-oriented brand image. Measuring approximately 184.6 inches in length, the Solterra adopts a crossover SUV form with distinctive styling elements including sharp, angular headlights, prominent black wheel arch cladding, and a coupe-like roofline with a split rear spoiler. Ground clearance of 8.3 inches maintains Subaru's traditional focus on off-road capability, supported by a new dual-motor all-wheel drive system dubbed 'Symmetrical All-Wheel Drive e-SUBARU,' with one electric motor powering each axle for a combined output of 215 horsepower and 248 lb-ft of torque. Powered by a 72.8 kWh lithium-ion battery, the Solterra offers an EPA-estimated range of approximately 220-230 miles depending on trim level, with DC fast-charging capability allowing for an 80% charge in about an hour under ideal conditions. The interior features a minimalist design centered around a high-mounted 12.3-inch touchscreen infotainment system and a digital instrument cluster positioned far forward on the dashboard, creating a unique spatial arrangement. Standard equipment includes heated front seats, a heat pump system for efficient climate control in cold weather, and Subaru's EyeSight driver assistance technology offering adaptive cruise control, pre-collision braking, and lane-keeping assistance. Off-road oriented features include X-Mode with Grip Control, which optimizes the electric motors' output for varying terrain, and Downhill Assist Control for controlled descents on steep gradients. While sharing its fundamental architecture with Toyota's bZ4X, the Solterra features distinct tuning and design elements. Sales began in mid-2022 across Japan, US, Canada, Europe, and China."

    description: "The 2025 facelift for the Subaru Solterra, unveiled at the New York Auto Show for the 2026 model year, introduced significant updates including a new front end design, 25 percent range improvement over the pre-facelift model, and increased power output to 375 horsepower thanks to stronger front and rear motors. The battery size was increased to 74.7 kWh, improving overall efficiency and range. A new Solterra XT trim was added, featuring more powerful dual electric motors producing a combined 375 horsepower output for enhanced performance. The updated model also features improved DC fast charging capabilities, allowing the vehicle to charge from 10% to 80% in approximately 30 minutes. Interior updates include a larger 14-inch infotainment display replacing the earlier 12.3-inch screen, with physical knobs for volume and climate control that were notably absent in the previous model. Exterior changes include revised styling with Toyota's new 'Hammerhead'-style front fascia and color-matched wheel arch panels replacing the previous black plastic overfenders. The vehicle continues to use the e-SUBARU Global Platform (e-SGP) and maintains Subaru's signature Symmetrical All-Wheel Drive system with X-Mode for off-road capability."
